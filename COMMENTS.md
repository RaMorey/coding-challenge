### Comments

Overall the challenge was good. 

Had I used my normal technologies I would consider it a fairly straightforward task. However, I thought I would try and do the challenge with the technologies already present:

1. Functional Components and Hooks (Never really used them, so some usage might be slightly off!)
2. CSS modules, I can definitely see the use of them but had some struggles against certain rules due to lack of knowledge and experience with them

I would be happy to do the challenge again in my normal workflow (Class components and Sass), should this work not be considered up to the level required.

## Tests

I appreciate that tests are very important to Iwoca, and they are to me as well. 

I normally never commit code without unit testing each component added.

Unfortunately, having not used hooks before, I struggled to get the tests I wanted to add into the code base in time for the allotted time frame given.

In Applications/Applications.test.js I have left some comments on how I would normally test a component and would be very happy to chat more about this.

As mentioned above, if you'd like to see how I usually test and to what level, I would be happy to redo the challenge with my usual workflow and include all the tests I normally would!

## Error handling

If I had more time to give I would have properly handled the various errors we could get, try/catch on api calls for example and then properly catchign and displaying the appropriate errors.

I also added in a static profile picture for each user. The reason for this was because the one that was auto generated wasn't working properly - not sure if that was me or if it just wasn't properly retrieving an image...
